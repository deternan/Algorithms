<h1>Feature selection</h1> 
Feature selection is a frequently used pre-processing technology for successful classification problem. Selecting a useful data subset as a classifier not only decreases the computational time and cost, but also increases the classification accuracy. 

This code we used genetic algorithm as feature selection to optimized dataset, it helps users to choose set of features, and use KNN (K-nearest neighbor) as fitness function to evaluate the classification performance.
