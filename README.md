<h1>Feature selection</h1> 
Feature selection is a frequently used pre-processing technology for successful classification problem. Selecting a useful data subset as a classifier not only decreases the computational time and cost, but also increases the classification accuracy. 

This code we used genetic algorithm as feature selection to optimized dataset, it helps users to choose set of features, and use KNN (K-nearest neighbor) as fitness function to evaluate the classification performance.

<h1>Classification</h1>

## K-nearest neighbor
A non-parametric method used for classification and regression. The input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression.

### Interface

we developed a Swing toolkit to exercise both of K-NN and SVM algorithms. It provides user a friendly control interface to carry out their classfied dataset.
